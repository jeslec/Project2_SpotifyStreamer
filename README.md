# DESCRIPTION 
This project is based on the highly popular music streaming app Spotify and was one of the assignments as part of the Android Nanodegree certification. Users can search for artists, see their top tracks, listen to streamed music samples and share the currently playing track. The fragments-based layout adapts to the device (phone, tablet) the app is running on to offer the best UI experience.
